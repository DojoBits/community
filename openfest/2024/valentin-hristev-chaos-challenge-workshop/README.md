## Overview

This is a Hands-on workshop for OpenFest 2024. The workshop is about Chaos
Engineering and Kubernetes. We will be using a simple application to demonstrate
how to containerize an application and deploy it on Kubernetes. We will also
demonstrate how to inject chaos into the application to test its resilience.

At the end we will play games and try to kill our application. Let's see if we
can achieve that ...

Inside the chaos-challenge-workshop folder you will find the Hands-on materials.
